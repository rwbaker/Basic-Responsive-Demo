#Hello#

This is a basic sorbet-themed demo for a responsive layout. Not mobile, responsive. There is a difference.

##About##

Basic media queries in c/base.css are responsible for the style changes on browser-resize.

The media query frame was taken from one of Nathan Smith's (sonspring.com) many projects, but I'm not sure which one.

Media queries work in IE9, Firefox 4, and Chrome, but not IE 6/7/8. I'm using scottjehl's Respond.js (https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) to bring IE into the game.
